#1. Understand the Data    The dataset contains both numeric and categorical variables. Some columns, like Passenger_count and trip_distance, may have unusual or missing values.
Null values were identified in certain columns, requiring handling (e.g., dropping or imputing missing values).

# 2 Sorting by total_amount revealed unusually high values, suggesting errors or special cases (e.g., negotiated fares or trips with excessive tolls).

# 3 Rows with extreme values for both variables differed, as high fares were often linked to high tolls rather than long distances.
